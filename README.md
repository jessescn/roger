# Le Roger :robot: :notes:

Roger is just a discord bot with bunch of random functions and more to come. Its just my learning test field. :bomb:

I used a roger to learn about Discord API and the `discord.py` library. I used others libraries just like `youtube-dl` to download and play youtube videos or `gTTS` to transform text to audio file and play in a discord voice channel.

**WARNING: Roger is instable and some features are still in working progress = may not work very well :relieved:**

## Just why?

I was tired programming and the roger was a way to find again fun creating something just for fun. Have some projects like this just to leave your imagination flows and have fun with your friends laughing for dump thinks its the best part of be a programmer :smile:

## Instalation

This project are using pipenv as package manager.You can install pipenv in your machine using this command:

```bash
pip install --user pipenv
```

## Execute

You need a `.env` file with `TOKEN=your-bot-token`, you can get this token in [Discord Deleloper Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), you just need to create a bot and get their token. After, execute this command:

```bash
pipenv run bot
```
